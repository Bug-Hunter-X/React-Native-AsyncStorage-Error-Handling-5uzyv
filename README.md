This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage and provides a solution for robust error handling.  The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `AsyncStorageSolution.js` presents the improved version with proper error handling using `try...catch` blocks.  This approach ensures the app doesn't crash due to AsyncStorage failures and provides a more user-friendly experience.
